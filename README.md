# odin-recipes
This is an exercises for The Odin Project to learn basic HTML. This repo will contain a basic site that I will use to demonstrate how to implement the things I learned so far.

### Things I learned:

- Link to a different page in a website.
- Add images to the website.
- Open a link in a new tab.
