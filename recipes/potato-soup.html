      <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning
          occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces
          on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is
          soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue
          cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute
          for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken
          stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are
          tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in
          flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream,
          tarragon, and cilantro. Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook,
          stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture
          to the potato mixture; stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and puree. Return to the
          Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste
